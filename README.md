CAD Design of MOSFET Structure, Grating, and TLM Using CleWin

## Overview
This repository contains CAD designs created using CleWin software for a MOSFET structure, grating, and Transfer Length Method (TLM) structures. These designs are essential for semiconductor device modeling and analysis, offering detailed layouts ready for fabrication.

## Project Contents
- mosfet_design.cif: CleWin file for the MOSFET structure design.
- grating_design.cif: CleWin file for the grating structure design.
- tlm_design.cif: CleWin file for the TLM structure design.

## Prerequisites
To view, edit, and design these structures, you’ll need:

- CleWin Software: CleWin is a powerful CAD tool specifically for designing photomasks and semiconductor devices. Ensure you have CleWin installed on your system.

## How to Open and View the Designs in CleWin
- Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

- Step 2: Launch CleWin
Open the CleWin software on your system.

### Step 3: Open the Design Files
- In CleWin, go to File > Open.
- Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository.
- Select the design file you want to view (mosfet_design.cif, grating_design.cif, or tlm_design.cif).
- Click Open.
- The selected design will now be displayed in the CleWin workspace.

### Step 4: Explore the Design
- Zoom In/Out: Use the mouse wheel or the zoom tools to explore the details of the design.
- Layers: Toggle different layers on and off to view specific parts of the design.
- Measurement Tools: Use CleWin’s measurement tools to examine dimensions and verify design specifications.

## How to Design MOSFET, Grating, and TLM Structures Using CleWin
### Step 1: Create a New Project
- In CleWin, go to File > New.
- Set up your workspace by defining the grid, units, and layers according to your design requirements.
### Step 2: Design the MOSFET Structure
- Layer Setup: Define layers for the gate, source, drain, substrate, and any other regions specific to your MOSFET design.
- Drawing Tools: Use the Rectangle, Polygon, and Path tools to create the layout for each region.
- Alignment Marks: Add alignment marks to ensure accurate fabrication.
- Dimensioning: Carefully set the dimensions for each region based on your device specifications.
### Step 3: Design the Grating Structure
- Grating Periodicity: Define the periodicity and dimensions of the grating.
- Repeating Patterns: Use CleWin’s array or copy-paste functionality to create the repeating pattern across the desired area.
- Fine-Tuning: Adjust the grating spacing and feature sizes to match the intended optical properties.
### Step 4: Design the TLM Structure
- Contact Pads: Design contact pads with defined widths and spacings to measure contact resistance.
- Spacing: Ensure the spacing between pads is consistent with TLM measurement requirements.
- Labeling: Add labels or annotations to easily identify different TLM regions during testing.
### Step 5: Save and Export the Design
- Save the Project: Go to File > Save As to save your project in the CleWin format (.cif or .gds).
- Export for Fabrication: If needed, export the design to a format compatible with your fabrication facility (e.g., GDSII).

## Customizing the Designs
Feel free to modify the provided designs:

- Adjust Dimensions: Modify the dimensions to suit different material properties or research requirements.
- Add New Layers: Incorporate additional layers for specific features or doping regions.
- Simulate: Before fabrication, consider simulating the designs using other tools to validate performance.
